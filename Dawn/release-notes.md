Dawn v5.0.0 introduces new ways to customize the look and feel of your store with a vertical product filter layout, mega menu header style, and a quick add button option. This update also features fixes and improvements, including several accessibility enhancements. 

### Added
- Important: We’ve introduced a new vertical product filter layout so you can further customize your store’s filters. You’ll find this setting in the collection and search templates. This update may cause a visual change to your theme. If you previously selected the “Collapse on desktop” checkbox, your filter layout will be changed to horizontal, which is the new default. If you’d like to achieve the collapsed style, select “Drawer” from the “Desktop filter layout” dropdown. 
- Important: You can now control the number of desktop and mobile grid columns in the collections list page, giving you more options to express your brand’s look and feel. This update may cause a layout change because columns will no longer automatically adjust to fill the available screen width. This can be modified by adjusting the number of columns setting.
- We’ve added the ability to choose a mega menu style in the header section, providing better support for menus with many items. 
- You can now enable a quick add button on your product cards, allowing your customers to quickly add items to their cart. Find this setting in the collection template and the featured collection section. 
- The featured collection section is now more flexible. You can control the description, text styles, button styles, and layout in the section settings. 
- You can now adjust how many products to show in the product recommendations section, allowing you more control over the layout of your store. 
- The theme’s product filtering functionality now supports boolean (true or false) custom filters. 

### Fixes and improvements

### Removed
